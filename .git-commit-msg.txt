Update main dashboard to show both invoice-based and hours-based data

- Monthly estimate now displays TWO sections side-by-side:
  * Invoice-based data (traditional, purple gradient)
  * Hours-based data (from logged hours, green gradient)
- Both sections show: income, expenses, net income
- Hours-based section uses same logic as monthly overview
- Automatic calculation for current month
- Visual badges to distinguish sections
- Color-coded cards for easy identification
- Fully responsive grid layout
- Both sections update independently and in parallel
